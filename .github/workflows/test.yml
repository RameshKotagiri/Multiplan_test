Workflow Details
1. Create TFC Project, Workspaces, and Assign Team Access
This workflow creates a Terraform Cloud project, a specified number of workspaces, and assigns write access to a team.

Behavior
Project Creation: Creates a project named oci-<system>-<app> unless it exists and confirm_reuse is set to YES.

Workspace Creation: Creates workspaces with names like oci-<system>-<app>-<usage>-poc-001 (if workspace_usage is provided) or oci-<system>-<app>-poc-001 (if not).

Team Management: Creates a team with the specified team_name and sso_id if it doesn't exist, then assigns write access to all created workspaces.

Safety Checks: Validates that the number of workspace_usage labels matches workspace_count and checks for existing projects/teams.

2. Delete TFC Project, Workspaces, and Team
This workflow deletes a specified project, its workspaces, and optionally a team in Terraform Cloud.

Behavior
Workspace Deletion: Deletes specified workspaces (if selected_workspaces is provided) or all workspaces under the project.

Project Deletion: Deletes the project after all workspaces are removed (if no specific workspaces are selected).

Team Deletion: Deletes the specified team if team_name is provided.

Safety Checks: Requires confirm_delete to be YES and verifies the existence of the project/team before deletion.

Best Practices
Naming Conventions: Use consistent system and app names to align with the oci-<system>-<app> pattern.

Input Validation: Ensure workspace_count matches the number of workspace_usage labels to avoid errors.

Safety Features: Always use confirm_reuse and confirm_delete to prevent accidental overwrites or deletions.
