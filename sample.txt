i DevOps Team,
I’m currently automating the creation of OCI credentials in Jenkins. I’ve successfully created credentials in the global domain using the endpoint $JENKINS_URL/credentials/store/system/domain/_/createCredentials. However, as per our discussion, I need to create these credentials in the OCI-POC/OCI-CCP folder, but I’m encountering a 404 "Not Found" error with the following endpoints I’ve tried:
$JENKINS_URL/job/OCI-POC/job/OCI-CCP/credentials/store/folder/domain/_/createCredentials → 404 Not Found  

$JENKINS_URL/job/OCI-POC/job/OCI-CCP/credentials/domain/_/createCredentials → 404 Not Found  

$JENKINS_URL/job/OCI-POC/job/OCI-CCP/credentials/createCredentials → 404 Not Found

Could you assist in identifying the correct Jenkins API endpoint for creating credentials in the OCI-POC/OCI-CCP folder?
